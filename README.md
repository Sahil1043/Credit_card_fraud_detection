Implemented logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) algorithms for fraud detection.
Utilized joblib, seaborn/matplotlib, SMOTE, scikit-learn/numpy/pandas   for class imbalance, data preprocessing, visualization and model training, serialization.
Achieved high accuracy scores of LR: 91.58\%, DT: 89.47\%, and RF: 91.58\% in underfitting scenarios, and LR: 97.15\%, DT: 99.84\%, and RF: 99.99\% in overfitting instances.
